# PGC-Agency-Finder

# About
This project is essentially a full stack web application that is used to look up PG County Government Agencies. The application works by entering the agency of interest, which results in a list being populated with the desired agencies. The list itself will display the name of the office,its address, and its agency. There is also a map function, which will display the location of each populated agency with the accompanying information in a pop-up banner. Furthermore, the Get All Offices button can be used to get all agencies on the map and in the list. Possble agencies users can enter are HEALTH,DPWT,COURTS,OCS,SOIL CONSERVATION,FIRE,PSC,DER,POLICE,SHERIFF,COUNTY EXECUTIVE,OHRM, and OIT.
